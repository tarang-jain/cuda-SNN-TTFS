# cuda-SNN

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are brain inspired networks that try to mimic biological information processing to perform tasks like classification in a highly sparse and power efficient manner. However, training and simulating these networks is extremely time consuming. This is because of an additional temporal domain as compared to traditional neural networks. However, there is a lot of scope for parallelizing the computations involved in training SNNs, both in the spatial and temporal domain. However, there is a lack of a generalized GPU- based training framework for SNNs which can exploit this. We propose a CUDA C based implementation of an SNN which uses a form of rank-order temporal coding called time-to-first- spike coding to enable GPU-based training for such SNNs. This approach reduces the simulation time by a factor of 358 as compared to a serial implementation and by a factor of 32 as compared to an OpenMP implementation using 16 threads.
